    <p>Hi my name is Husain, I am a apprentice softwear developer at Sky. 
        Normally I hate writing bio's as I just see it as blowing my own horn, 
        but I do see how they can be beneficial and an easy way to introduce yourself.  
        I like to think of myself as proactive and hard working this is definitely reflected in my work and hobbies.
        On the topic of hobbies, my hobbies consists of activitys that are normaly opposite to my work as I find it more refreshing having a divide.
        My hobbies are going to the gym, playing football, reading, and also sometimes(i.e. very offten) video games.
