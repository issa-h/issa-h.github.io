    <p>I am currently an apprentice softwear developer at sky but I have been many things before that.
        Went to Acton high school and sixthform studying Maths Chemistry and Physics at A-level. 
        I then transitioned in to universerty enrolling on an areospace engineering degree at Queen Mary London, dropping out after a year and a half.
        Between then and now I have worked at Nandos as a back of house staff, Servoca as a stadium steward, and Argos as a delivery driver.
        through all these positions I learned customer service, team work, communication, problem solving and many more qualities.
